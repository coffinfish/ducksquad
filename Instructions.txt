Ok, very cool instructions (feel free to ask me for help, I'll add images later)
1. Clone the Repository on VS code (unnecessary, but recommended if you don't know how to access a repo from an IDE)
To Do So:
    -Download VS Code (search it up on google)
    -Open a random file, and go to extensions on the bar on left
    -Click on it and search up the github extensions
    -Download it (unneccessary, but will make things easier)
    -Go back to where your file is
    -Click source control on the left
    -Click clone repository
    -Go back to the duck squad repository
    -Click the green code button
    -Click the copy button beside the link
    -Go back to the clone repository button in VS Code and paste the link
    -Put the Repository in a folder you will remember

2. Create a Branch (or ask me to make one for you)
To Do So:
    Option 1: In GitHub
    -Click 'main' underneath the pull request tab towards the upper left
    -Type in your branch name
    -Click on main again and tap on your new branch, make sure you are now in the branch
    -Proceed to the access branch section
    
    Option 2: In VS code
    -Go to your source control (on the left bar)
    -Under Source Control Repository, click main (beside the weird blobby circles)
    -Click 'new branch from' option
    -Click main
    -Name your branch

3. Access your branch
To Do So:
    Option 1: In Terminal
    -Click View at the top of VS Code
    -Click Terminal
    -In Terminal type: git checkout branchName (replace branch name with the name of your branch)

    Option 2: In SourceControl 
    -Click Source Control on the left
    -Click main (beside the bubble drawing thing, under Source Control Repositories)
    -Find and switch to your branch name (If the branch name is not there, try refreshing VS Code or text me for help)

4. Code!
To Do So:
    -Add a file and whatever you want to do! (Just try to keep it in your own branch, and ask before merging to the main)
    -Check the GitHub Quick Tutorial File for brief intro to pulling, pushing, merging, and commiting (TBA), which would really be all I think you need to work the repo
    -Please don't mess around in other peoples'branches without permission, and avoid working directly in the main branch.
    -Have fun! And don't be scared to break everything! (I mean I already broke a rover and that cost money, so you'll be fine...)
