Ok, very cool instructions (feel free to ask me for help, I'll add images later)
1. Get the repository cloned on VS code
To Do So:
    -Download VS Code (search it up on google)
    -Open a random file, and go to extensions on the bar on left
    -Click on it and search up the github extensions
    -Download it
    -Go back to where your file is
    -Click source control on the left
    -Click clone repository
    -Go back to the duck squad repository
    -Click the green code button
    -Click the copy button beside the link
    -Go back to the clone repository button in VS Code and paste the link
    -Put the Repository in a folder you will remember

2. Create a Branch (or ask me to make one for you)
To Do So:
    Option 1: In GitHub
    -Click 'main' underneath the pull request tab towards the upper left
    -Type in your branch name
    -Click on main again and tap on your new branch, make sure you are now in the branch
    -Proceed to the access branch section
    
    Option 2: In VS code
    -Go to your source control ()
